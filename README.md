# Used-Car

The objective was to develop a predictive model for used car prices using a dataset of car features.  This involved identifying and quantifying the relationships between car attributes (e.g., mileage, age, make, model, features) and their corresponding sale prices.  The model was evaluated based on its predictive accuracy and the interpretability of feature importances to understand which factors most significantly influence used car valuation

Report for Used Car Dealers: Used Car Price Optimization

Introduction

 This report summarizes our findings on the key factors influencing used car prices,  based on an analysis of a dataset of used vehicle listings.  The goal is to provide actionable insights to help you optimize your inventory and pricing strategies.

Key Findings
Our analysis reveals several key factors that significantly impact a used car's price:

1. Odometer Reading: Lower mileage vehicles generally command higher prices.  
Focus on acquiring and showcasing low-mileage cars to attract buyers willing to pay a premium.

2. Vehicle Age: Newer cars tend to be more expensive.  
Carefully manage the age of your inventory, balancing newer models with potentially higher acquisition costs against the higher prices they can fetch.
3. Fuel Type:  Certain fuel types (e.g. hybrid, electric) may be more desirable and command higher prices than others.  Consider market trends and consumer preferences for fuel efficiency when sourcing vehicles.
4. Transmission Type:  Automatic transmissions might be more popular, potentially influencing price. Monitor the market trends for manual vs automatic and adjust your inventory to reflect demand.
5. Body Style:  Certain body styles (e.g., SUVs) might be more in demand, and therefore more expensive. Align your inventory with body styles that are currently popular with buyers.

Methodology
We used a variety of data science techniques to analyze a dataset of used car listings, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling. Specifically, we employed Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression models. After comparing different models, we chose the model with the best performance, determined by R-squared and cross validation R-squared metrics, which was the Lasso Regression Model. The model's coefficients were inspected to understand the influence of different features.
Model Performance
The chosen Lasso Regression model showed a strong predictive capability, with a high R-squared score on the test set. The high cross-validation R-squared scores suggest the model generalizes well.

Recommendations
Based on our findings, we recommend the following actions:
1. Pricing Strategy: Adjust pricing to reflect the impact of mileage and age.  Consider offering competitive prices for lower-mileage, newer vehicles and strategically price older or higher-mileage vehicles.  The analysis further indicates that the condition of the car has a positive relationship with the price. Hence, it's crucial to represent the condition accurately in advertisements and listings.

2. Inventory Management: Focus on acquiring and maintaining a selection of vehicles with lower mileage and age. Optimize to adjust your inventory mix to include more in-demand fuel types and body styles.


3. Market Analysis: Continuously monitor market trends to ensure your pricing and inventory strategies remain relevant.  The used car market is influenced by various factors and periodic recalibration of models and strategies would provide an advantage.

4. Further Analysis:  Consider expanding the analysis to include other factors that might influence pricing, such as fuel type or additional features. We also recommend more sophisticated analysis of outliers. 

Conclusion
By implementing these recommendations, you can improve your pricing strategies, enhance inventory management, and ultimately increase profitability.  This will assist you in fine tuning your inventory and better serve your customers.
